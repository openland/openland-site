				p Openland makes it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;buy land for new construction. We&nbsp;cover all types of&nbsp;development sites, including vacant land, parking lots, and buildings that can be&nbsp;demolished and replaced. We&nbsp;also support multiple transaction types: purchase, joint venture, ground lease, or&nbsp;option-to-buy. Today land acquisition is&nbsp;a&nbsp;slow, manual, relationship-driven process. Most deals happen off-market, without a&nbsp;public announcement or&nbsp;auction.
				p Better land acquisition solutions are desperately needed to&nbsp;reallocate space from "old use" to&nbsp;"new use". The old use is&nbsp;parking, manufacturing, military, traditional retail, and dirty energy. New use is&nbsp;dense housing, modern workspaces, infrastructure for electric cars, clean energy, and delivery-oriented retail. A&nbsp;transparent and efficient land market will have massive positive impact on&nbsp;cities and economy. It&nbsp;will create more housing, more jobs and better infrastructure.
